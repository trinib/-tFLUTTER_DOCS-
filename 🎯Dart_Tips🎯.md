`Callback` is basically a function or a method that we pass as an argument into another function or a method to perform an action
#
`Constructor` is a special method of Dart class which is automatically called when the object is created. The constructor is like a function with/without parameter but it doesn't have a return type
#
An `object` is an abstract data type potentially containing attributes (data) and methods (behavour)
#
An `argument` is a value passed a command or function. You pass function like func(1. 2), 1&2 are the argument
#
A `statement` is a single line of valid code that completes dome task
#
`Constant` is defined as an immutable object, which means it can't be changed or modified _during the execution of the program_. Once we initialize the value to the constant variable, it cannot be reassigned later but if change one manually it will change everywhere.
#
`=+` is when you want to add a value to existing value
#
`Increment` is the process of increasing by a specific amount, or the amount by which something increases. An example of an increment is an annual salary increase of 5%. noun.
#
String `interpolation` is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values. A little snippet to interpolate a Map in a string in Dart and Flutter using double curly braces syntax (can be easily changed)
#
All Dart classes inherit by default from the Object class. They can have public and private members, and a useful getter and setter syntax lets you use fields interchangeably with `properties` without affecting users of the class.
#
`==` Comparison operator
#
`!=` not equal to operator
#
`toString()` is an in-built method that returns the value given to it in string format. Hence, any object that this method is applied on, will then be returned as a string object
#
The annotation `@override` marks an instance member as overriding a superclass member with the same name. The annotation applies to instance methods, getters and setters, and to instance fields, where it means that the implicit getter and setter of the field is marked as overriding, but the field itself is not
#
`Prefix` mean before & `Suffix` mean after
